# 🚀 Hands-on Networking: Configured NAT Protocol in Cisco Packet Tracer

I'm excited to share that I successfully configured the **Network Address Translation (NAT)** protocol using **Cisco Packet Tracer**! 💻📡

This project allowed me to:

 <p>🔹 Translate private IP addresses to public IPs for internet access  
  <p>🔹 Implement Static NAT, Dynamic NAT, and PAT (Port Address Translation)  
  <p>🔹 Understand how NAT enhances network security and IP address conservation

## 📝 Project Overview

This project involves the implementation of NAT (Network Address Translation) using Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes **two internal networks** and an additional **ISP router** setup.

Initially, the internal networks could communicate with each other but not with the ISP network, as it uses public IP addresses while the internal networks use private IP addresses.

After configuring the NAT protocol on **Router 2**, the internal hosts were able to access the ISP network. This translation from private to public IP addresses allowed proper communication across networks, simulating a real-world internet access scenario.
